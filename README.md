# CiviCRM Group Nodes

This module will provide simple synchronization between Backdrop Nodes and
CiviCRM Groups based on rules defined by the administrator.

This will allow a variety of references between Backdrop functionality and
CiviCRM contacts via this relationship. For example:
 - Automatic landing pages with friendly URLs for CiviCRM Contacts (through
   the referenced node).
 - Enabling Backdrop comments on a contact node.
 - Allowing Backdrop fields (such as Term References or any other) to be
   associated with a CiviCRM contact.
 - Using third-party modules like FiveStar to allow ratings in Backdrop which
   are associated with a CiviCRM Contact.
